# PacMan
Pacman maze builder and path visualizer - By Nathan Cheshire

For the midterm project for CSE4633 (Intro to Artificial Intelligence) I decided to implement Pac-Man in Java FXML and allow the user to customize the search algorithms used
The user is also able to enable/disable certain ghosts, visualize each path each ghost will take, and activate hard mode

Many nights of sleep were lost on this project but all in all I had fun doing it and learned a great deal about game development and path finding algorithms.

As a bonus, I implemented a maze generator which uses a backtracking algorithm called Prim's algorithm for weighted, undirected, minimal spanning trees. Backtracking is also a search technique applicable to AI which is why I decided to implement this feature

The Jar file is inside of the jar directory or you may clone the whole project and tweak the source code via an IDE.
